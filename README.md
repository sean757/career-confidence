PROJECT OUTLINE 
Name of program: Career Confidence 
We live in an age where all the information in the world can be found using a simple google search. With this, all aspects of our lives have been made easier. From finding citations for a research paper to learning cooking recipes, the possibilities are endless. However, despite these tools there is a massive issue that has plagued our society. A lack of judgement. This lack of judgement may affect us as we may over or underestimate our skills, whether these be physical skills and talents to assessing our own writing. One key demographic in which this issue has hit hardest is job hunters. While on the search for a job, we may draft up CV’s with the idea that we’ve got it all right or fail to do so under the assumption that we’ve misunderstood the process. This is where Career Confidence comes in. Career Confidence will evaluate a candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications, and compare them to the requirements of the job description, to determine the likelihood of them landing the job. By leveraging the power of technology, we can help bridge the gap between the vast information available online and the practical application of that knowledge in the job market. 

Credits to justicea83 for pydparser, my discovery of it was pivotal in the completion of this project.
Some very lazy solutions can be found, might eventually rewrite this without the low quality code
